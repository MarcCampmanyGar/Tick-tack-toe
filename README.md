# tick-tack-toe game

Tick-tack-toe game done in python following youtube videos from [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/c/sentdex) Youtube channel on ['Learning to program with Python 3"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXBD2bB9-RA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln)

## How to play?
1. Execute the .py file directly on command line.
2. Introduce the size of the board. Example: 3 would mean a 3x3 board.
3. Player 1 moves:
    - indicate column (0, 1 or 2)
    - indicate row (0, 1 or 2)
4. Player 2 moves:
    - indicate column (0, 1 or 2)
    - indicate row (0, 1 or 2)
5. When a line is completed by a single player the game ends and asks if you want to plau again (y/n)

## Improvements
- Allignement of the cells with the pieces of each player
- Each movement (column+row) indicated in a single line
